  classText: Combat Medic
  descText: 'A shapeshifter who even Demon''s Fear. Sends out perodic messages to
    all Champions, Asterians and Demons for checkups. It is worth mentioning that
    Doctor can somehow find anyone in Asteria even if they are in a deadzone. No one
    knows how he is able to do this but his reputation is feared by all, including
    Demons.


    While his class is a combat medic, he spends less time healing and more time dismembering
    his opponents.


    His signature weapon are claws located on his right hand that, if allow to create
    a cut or incision anywhere on the victim''s body, will shoot out a web of the
    organs within a 8 inch radius around that incision. With this ability, Doctor
    can very easily remove. expand, shrink or even create new organs and easily implant
    them inside with minimal effort.'
